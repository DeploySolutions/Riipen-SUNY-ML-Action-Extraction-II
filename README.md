# Riipen-Project-UAlbany-Summer-2020
Goal: Extracting imperative sentences, keywords and phrases from climate change documents using Natural Language Processing(NLP) and AWS rekogition and experimenting with sentiment analysis on the results.

Objectives - Recommend a set of actions that ordinary citizens can take to avoid, mitigate, adapt, or rebuild from climate change disasters. Although there is a wealth of guidance information out there in PDFs or on websites, rather than go through those one by one, we want machine learning NLP and NLU techniques (and others?) to be applied that can automatically extract that kind of guidance from a PDF document or body of text.
